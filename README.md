# Pokemon-Image-Classifier_Using_CNN
This project implements a simple neural network from scratch using NumPy to classify images of Pok√©mon (Pikachu, Bulbasaur, Meowth). The model has two hidden layers and is trained using gradient descent and backpropagation. The dataset contains 40x40 images, and the model is evaluated using confusion matrices and classification reports.
